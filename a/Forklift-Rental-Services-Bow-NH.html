<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Used for handling large amount of materials, this product is designed with a high level of precision at par with international quality parameters. Whatever materials handling task you need fulfilling, Cat Lift Trucks offer you one of the most dependable and complete counterbalance forklifts in the industry. The most notable feature of the rough terrain forklift is the oversized, aggressive treaded tires.</p>
<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>
