<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>
<p>Whether tough outdoor use or classic stacking in the warehouse; whether pallet truck, order picker or narrow aisle truck; if you need to move a few hundredweight or several tons - at Jungheinrich Rental you always get the right truck. In order to ensure quality, these pallet trucks are stringently tested on several parameters by Our qualified experts. We are your source for the best daily, weekly, or monthly prices on rentals including Cat, Hyster, and Toyota brands.</p>

<p>Unless you are very experienced and know what to look for when inspecting a forklift, have a qualified mechanic or knowledgeable operator carry out the inspection. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>
<p>Between a 45° forward tilt and a 15° rear tilt, the H Series forklift offers the most mast tilt in the industry, allowing operators to keep loads level on any terrain or slope.
