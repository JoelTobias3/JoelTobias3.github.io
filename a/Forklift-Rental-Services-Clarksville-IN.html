<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers. There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture. One of the key features of this type of forklift is that they are counterbalanced — meaning that the battery also functions as a counterweight for stability. Optimize your storage capacity by operating in narrow aisles at high picking levels with Raymond Orderpicker trucks.</p>
<p>When you need power out of your forklifts, turn to Tynan for all the power you can handle. Employers must certify that operators have received all necessary training and evaluate each operator at least once every three years. The AC motors that power order pickers deliver smooth controllable power for speedy operation and precise control, without the expensive cost of diesel fuel.</p>

<p>The Southeast team has years of experience managing large forklift companies, owning and operating wholesale forklift companies and turning wrenches when we need to. Consider what you will be using your forklift for and what processes you want to optimise before choosing any new machinery and training employees. Like class 1 forklifts, class 2s are also battery-powered and are more optimally used within a warehouse rather than out in the shipping yard.</p>
<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>

Whilst there are some limitations - such as the electric battery and low ground clearance - if used in the correct manner a reach forklift can be a valuable addition to a savvy warehouse's equipment.</p>
