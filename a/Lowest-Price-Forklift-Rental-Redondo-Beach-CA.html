<p>Equipment Solutions for Your Short and Long-term Rental Needs. Counterbalance forklift trucks are versatile and can be operated both indoors and outdoors. H&E were founded in 1961 and have been providing equipment rental for more than 50 years. MARCOM's Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks training has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
<p>To obtain a forklift licence in any State or Territory an applicant must undertake a training course with an approved training organisation and then, on completion of the course, apply to the appropriate State or Territory for a forklift licence. If you are not sure how everything works in a lifted truck that you want to test drive, ask questions. Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>
<h2>Counterbalanced Forklift Trucks in Redondo Beach </h2>
<p>If you do most of your work indoors it is unlikely that you'll ever need one, but rough terrain forklifts are a must for outdoor applications and construction sites. Note: Service calls are not officially logged until you hear back from an Eastern Lift Truck Co. employee. It is suggested that powered industrial trucks be painted a color which will comply with the USA Standard Safety Color Code for Marking Physical Hazards and the Identification of Certain Equipment, Z53.1-1967.</p>
<p>Our counterbalance forklift training courses follow a specific set of guidelines as determined by NPORS & ITSSAR to ensure your staff are trained to the highest standard. They have dual forks at the front of the truck and a weight in the back to offset the weight of the load in the front. It is nice to have the selection of on-line, PPT, and video training to choose from., and the additional materials and forms made setting up our forklift safety program a snap.</p>
<p>Guide rails, or electronic (or similar) guidance are suggested when lift trucks are operating in an area only used for stock pickers, side loaders, or order pickers.

And one of the biggest barriers to making your warehouse work for you is the forklifts you have at your disposal. Use: Most commonly used forklift in the U.S. Primarily used indoors in warehouse type operations, good for use on smooth surfaces only. Overall Height Raised = The maximum extended height of the top of the load backrest or fork carriage of a completely extended mast.</p>
<p>OSHA requires that all forklift operators' performances be evaluated at least once every three years. With more than 50 models to choose from, our forklifts are manufactured with superior quality. This type of forklift is suited for uneven surfaces with its sturdy pneumatic tires. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>

You can avoid these charges by utilizing your own LP Gas tanks or filling up the fuel tanks prior to returning the rental equipment. In a warehouse, a forklift can navigate tight spaces, reaching areas that other vehicles cannot.</p>
