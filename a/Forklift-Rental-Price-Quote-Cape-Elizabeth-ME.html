We're here to answer your questions and to finally put to rest which is better, a lifted truck or a lowered truck.

Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>
