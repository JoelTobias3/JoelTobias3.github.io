On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option.

<h2>Fork Lifting Training Red Bluff</h2>
<p>All personnel required to operate a Industrial Counterbalance Forklift Truck should complete this training and testing. It is also backed with priority support from our nationwide team of field service forklift technicians. While it can't reach difficult angles the way that a telehandler can, it is capable of lifting payloads much higher off the ground than a warehouse forklift and heavier loads.</p>

This is achieved by two outer legs which distribute the load weight and prevent the forklift from tipping.

<p>The new lift truck is powered by a 4-cylinder, 2-liter LP engine with powershift transmission. Mitsubishi counterbalance forklifts are designed for exceptional comfort and increased productivity - from beginning of the shift to the end. Some order pickers are in a climate-controlled environment, while others work in sub-freezing temperatures. Invest in a quality kit from a reputable manufacturer and work with an experienced mechanic to ensure that your lifted truck provides optimal performance both on and off the road.</p>
