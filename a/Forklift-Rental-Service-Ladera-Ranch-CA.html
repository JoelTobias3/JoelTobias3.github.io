All-terrain and off-road tires in very large sizes can be crucial for conquering particularly difficult and hazardous trails.</p>
<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>

<p>All personnel required to operate a Industrial Counterbalance Forklift Truck should complete this training and testing.

<p>At Thompson Machinery, we've invested in a fleet of Cat forklifts, so you don't have to. Simply let us know when you need your forklift and for how long. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see. Electric forklifts are suited for indoor use and have several advantages.</p>

With breakthrough lift heights, capacities, visibility and energy savings, the Crown family of reach trucks can help you move and store materials efficiently.</p>
<p>You don't want a supplier who does not have the resources to supply you the right rental equipment when you need it.

Our Rough Terrain Forklift Train the Trainer Course, as well as our other Train the Trainer courses, are a great option for organizations looking to have one or more employees that can teach and certify various safety topics relevant to your business.</p>
<p>As for the right amount of lift, a 2-, 4-, or 6-inch lift kit (or more) will give you more clearance for driving off-road.
