<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>So while you may find cheaper custom trucks elsewhere, we doubt they'll compare to the quality you get from us. Granite industrial carries an inventory full of used Baker and Linde forklift truck parts. Most order picker forklifts have a 4-point suspension mechanism between the rear tires and the front wheels. The wheels and tires are key components that set rough terrain forklifts apart from standard models.</p>

<p>This selection of forklift truck features large pneumatic tires, with deep treads enabling the operators to drive on rough road or ground cover without sliding or slipping. Spiker Equipment specializes in used forklift sales service & rentals directly at our facility in the Edmonton, Alberta ares. At Forklift Hire Services we regard your enquiry as the beginning of a relationship which will see your business move forward knowing that you have the solution that is right for your particular application.</p>
<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>
<p>When you rent a rough terrain forklift, you don't have to wait long to get to work. Daystar "Comfort Ride" Lift Kits combine the best of both worlds in order to give you the most optimal suspension lift all while staying within a reasonable budget. Flexibility is critical for businesses and renting forklifts can be a surprisingly easy way to cut costs on a short-term basis.</p>

We sell, rent and support the full lines of Cat, Mitsubishi, Jungheinrich and Taylor Lift Trucks. If you're a more adventurous driver that likes to go off-road, a lifted truck is a great way to enable you to challenge yourself to take on more difficult terrain.</p>

Even if you specified you would need the rental for a specific amount of time, i.e. 2 days, it is the renters responsibility to make sure the equipment is returned.</p>
