<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. Not move the truck and remain at the controls at all times, if operating an industrial lift truck with a forklift platform with an employee on the platform. For trucks with tilting forks, the forks shall be horizontal or at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable. If you work in a job that requires you to use a forklift primarily outdoors on natural or uneven terrain, even occasionally or rarely, you need rough terrain forklift training.</p>
<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
