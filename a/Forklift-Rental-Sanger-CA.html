<p>Understand the causes of instability of the truck and loads. We're always out looking for a great deal on a pre-owned forklift, so that we can be the main source you look to when you are wanting to purchase one. Overall, a sit-down forklift is the right call for operations that need several hours of forklift work a day, or need to put their operator's comfort, safety, and accessibility first.</p>
