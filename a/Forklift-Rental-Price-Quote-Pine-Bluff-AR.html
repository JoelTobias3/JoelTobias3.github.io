<p>Using the procedure outlined for these tests, a truck shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 per cent slope for loaded truck (Test #N5), and a 14 percent or 18 percent slope for unloaded truck (Test #N5A), depending on whether the truck has single rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual rear-wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>

Short Term forklift rental solutions can help you react immediately to a situation with a predicted cost. In a changing and fluctuating market, the rough-terrain forklift and telehandler sector is not without its challenges.</p>
