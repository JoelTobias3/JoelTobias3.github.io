<p>They have small tires designed to run on paved surfaces and are usually powered by an internal combustion engine running on gasoline, diesel, or propane fuel. Lift Capacity: 16000 lbs.

<h3>High Reach Forklift Albany NY</h3>
<p>For off road purposes, lifting a truck is the best way to improve its performance. In terms of volume, the global Pallet Trucks market is estimated to exhibit attractive growth rate over the forecast period. In the past this job was done with either ladders, a dangerous and ineffective solution, or with reach trucks with goods on pallets and blocked aisles. When the operator is done with pallet jack, he or she shouldn't leave the equipment just sitting out anywhere.</p>
<p>Forklifts weigh thousands of lbs. For true off-road operations requiring superior traction, there are also four-wheel drive rough-terrain forklifts. From a higher center of gravity to reduced visibility in close quarters, a lifted truck or SUV certainly comes with additional roadway safety challenges. While a dealership may not seem like the obvious choice to install your vehicle's lift kit, Currie's years of rigorous training, certification and experience in lift kit installation has made them the go-to experts in suspension enhancement.</p>
<p>Many countries and regions require fork lift operator training and, in some cases, a fork lift operator license, due to the potentially dangerous nature of the work and the high value of merchandise handled by lifts.

<h3>High Quality Industrial Electric Lifters Albany NY 12203</h3>
<p>From maintenance vehicles and scissor lifts to electric burden carriers, personnel carriers, utility and specialty vehicles, and other warehouse equipment , we have a wide selection of solutions available with short- or long-term rental agreements to meet your changing business needs while minimizing the impact on your budget. Construction, heavy industry and mining continue to take advantage of rough- and all-terrain forklifts, while construction and agriculture have discovered the versatility of telehandlers.</p>
<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain.
