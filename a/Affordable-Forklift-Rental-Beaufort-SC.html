<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support. Call Andy Putnam, Rental Manager (315) 413-4150 or use the Rentals Request form to send us a Quick Request.</p>
<p>At its 2019 National Forklift Safety Day in Washington, D.C., ITA members discussed how there are currently more than 4.5 million truck operations currently employed in more than 300 industries nationwide.
