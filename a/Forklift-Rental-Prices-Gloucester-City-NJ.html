<p>3-wheel counterbalance forklift trucks are similar to 4-wheel counterbalance machines. When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials. The redesign includes modifying the forklift chain and the mast inner channel to create a wider window creating better visibility. The lift trucks are used to unload, lift, lower and stack pallet loads, or other bulk loads into storage and transportation racks and facilities.</p>
