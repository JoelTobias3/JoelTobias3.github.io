<p>A forklift that raises your intralogistics to a new level. But as a general rule, most forklifts can take a multitude of different sizes and configurations. Rarely will you find a lifted truck that still has the stock tires on it. Larger off road tires are not designed to maximize road performance.

The Yale electric order pickers offer quiet, effortless operation and an abundance of features, all focused on ensuring operators can achieve faster, more accurate, order picking no matter the order picker.</p>

The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily. The Hummer seems to be able to age well no matter how old it gets; and it also somehow avoids the Tonka toy look that sometimes befouls trucks when you try to put tires too large on them.</p>

TPC's video training on Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
