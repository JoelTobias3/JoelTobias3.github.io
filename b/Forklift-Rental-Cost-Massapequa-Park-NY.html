Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>

Our range of diesel powered forklift trucks , gas powered forklift trucks and electric powered forklift trucks are designed to fulfil a range of requirements; coming in a variety of sizes and with various abilities to suit your needs.
