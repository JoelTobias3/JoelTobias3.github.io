<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend.

Battery-operated reach trucks are gaining popularity among end use industries, owing to their ability to handle double pallet and horizontal transport.</p>

A walk-behind narrow aisle lift truck with a 3,000 to 4,000 pound capacity costs approximately $15,000 to $18,000. Lifted trucks with a body lift have physical spacers or blocks installed between the body and the frame of the truck.</p>
