<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>To obtain a forklift licence in any State or Territory an applicant must undertake a training course with an approved training organisation and then, on completion of the course, apply to the appropriate State or Territory for a forklift licence. If you are not sure how everything works in a lifted truck that you want to test drive, ask questions. Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>

<p>Increase your buying power: Besides enjoying an upfront saving, you'll also be able to buy two used forklifts with the same price of purchasing a new forklift. When people think of forklifts, they usually imagine the small vehicle with two forks on the front that's used for lifting pallets. For many people, the I'm on top of the world” feeling that comes with driving a lifted truck is enough to warrant buying one.</p>
<p>In addition to simply driving a fork lift, working as a fork lift operator requires the ability to properly lift, balance, and stack heavy loads that are ordinarily arranged on a wood pallet or a pallet made from other materials. They offer a streamlined credit approval process so you can rent forklifts (and other equipment, if needed) without paying the full price up front.</p>

<p>It is imperative that you make a good sound and informed decision to ensure that you purchase the right forklift for the job within your desired budget. However, lifting provides many advantages for off-road use, including greater approach, breakover, and departure angles. Counterbalance forklifts have no extending arms, giving them the ability to move directly to the load.</p>
