Heubel Shaw's large rental fleet includes Reach trucks, Stand up forklifts, sitdown 4-wheel and 3-wheel forklifts, order pickers and pallet jacks. Rather than installing between the body and frame, these kits are used to physically increase the height of the suspension for the pickup, which raises the body and frame.</p>
<p>JCB RT forklift models include the 930, 940, and 950, respectively rated at 6,000, 8,000, and 10,000 pounds lift capacity.
