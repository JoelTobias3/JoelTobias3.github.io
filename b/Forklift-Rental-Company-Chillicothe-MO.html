<p>The answers are also important for you to choose the correct forklift attachments to do the job at hand. Whether your team needs forklifts every day or on rare occasion, renting forklifts may be the best fiscal option. Green Spaces: Since rough terrain forklifts can handle loose ground and can move backfill, they work well in green spaces.
