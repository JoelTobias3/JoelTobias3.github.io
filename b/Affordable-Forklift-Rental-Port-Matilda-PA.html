<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>Parts & Service - Our forklift parts and service departments are ready at a moments notice and can repair any brand of equipment in your fleet. Every rental truck is prepped by a Raymond certified technician and quality inspected by our shop foreman to make sure that each piece of equipment is ready to work when it reaches your facility. When you need to move materials, shift supplies, or store objects on a job site, a rough terrain forklift can do the job.</p>

Truck should be placed on an initially level test platform with the axis of the load wheels parallel to the tilting axis of the platform.</p>

One of our most popular and material handling equipment in demand is Electric Pallet Trucks. Highly versatile low-lift pallet skid handler for loads 3,000 - 8,000lbs.

<p>Based on region, the global pallet truck market can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and South America. That's very good for an electric forklift. These changes can actually improve the handling of a pickup, however, and there is no limit, beyond a practical one, to how much lift this kind of kit can give a truck. Whether you have seasonal business, a temporary increase in workload, or are taking on a special project with a definite endpoint, leasing a forklift is probably the way to go. And the money you save by leasing can be put into what matter most: growing the business.</p>
