It may be necessary to travel long distances with the load to the rear in reverse for most forklifts. Frequency of use and pallet transport distance should be taken into consideration when choosing between manual and electric pallet trucks.</p>

Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need.
