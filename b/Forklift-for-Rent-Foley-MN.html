Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida.

<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>Decrease speed at all corners, sound horn and watch the swing of both the rear of the lift truck and the load. On the other hand, they can be less stable when turning with loads and have a limited capacity range. Reach trucks are categorized as Class 2 lift trucks in material handling.
